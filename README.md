# 🛍️ Pet Project – Online Store
 This project was created as part of a training assignment during my studies. It’s a multi-page online store with essential e-commerce functionality, built entirely from scratch without templates or pre-made solutions. The design was implemented based on a Figma layout.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
**React** – *for building the component-based UI*

**React Router Dom** – *for client-side routing*

**React Transition Group** – *for page transition animations*

**Redux & Redux Toolkit** – *for global state management*

**TypeScript** – *for static typing and improved code reliability*

**SCSS Modules** – *for modular and scoped component styling*

## 💡 Features
* Cart, favorites, and theme (light/dark) are saved in localStorage
* Product sorting options:
  * by price (lowest first)
  * by recency
  * alphabetically
* Option to select number of products per page
* Fully responsive layout: supports mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
