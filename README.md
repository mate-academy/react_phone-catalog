[DEMO](https://maksymmohyla.github.io/react_phone-catalog)

This open-source single-page application was made by me, a web developer from Ukraine [Maksym Mohyla](https://www.linkedin.com/) using the following technologies: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, SCSS modules, and some libraries i.e., Redux Toolkit, classnames, react-router-dom, etc. [I used this free markup from Figma](<https://www.figma.com/design/BUusqCIMAWALqfBahnyIiH/Phone-catalog-(V2)-Original-Dark?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=xv1Vsy2o6AHmrbRy-0>). This app provides a responsive interface that is intuitively understandable on phones, tablets, and desktop screens. Additionally, I used mock server requests with an internal API, developed functional components for basic online store functions: adding or removing products in your cart or favorites page (using browser local storage so data will be saved between browser sessions), filtering lists of products, routing through single-page app components, a fully working and responsive image carousel (without using any libraries for it), hover effects for interactive elements, added Ukrainian language etc. The best code practices were used: DRY (don't repeat yourself), the code is concise, clear, and there are written comments for difficult points.
