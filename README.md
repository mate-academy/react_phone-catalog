SCSS Modules for scoped, maintainable styles

React Router for navigation

GitHub Pages for deployment

🔑 My Contributions & Improvements

Implemented clean folder/module structure (src/modules/*) to keep codebase scalable and organized.

Optimized React Context usage to avoid unnecessary re-renders in cart and favorites.

Added localStorage persistence for cart & favorites, so user data isn’t lost on refresh.

Created mobile-first responsive layout with SCSS utilities and grid system.

Improved code quality by enforcing TypeScript types across components (safer and more reliable than many similar student projects).

Paid attention to accessibility and semantics (proper ARIA roles, alt tags, keyboard-friendly navigation).
